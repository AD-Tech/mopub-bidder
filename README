We provide two examples of servers implementing simple bidding strategies.   

Our appengine_bidder provides a simple interface for dealing with large amounts
of data. However for more complex algorithms, it may become difficult to respond
within the 90ms window we allow for real-time bidders.

Our tornado_bidder provides a more customizable interface, at the expense of 
additional configuration time.
