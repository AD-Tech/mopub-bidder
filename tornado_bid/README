This is the MoPub tornado_bidder. 

It is built on tornado with an nginx frontend.

Install tornado here:
http://www.tornadoweb.org/

Run 1 worker on port 8000 with: 
$ python tornado_bidder.py       

or run 4 workers on ports 8000 - 8003 with:
$ python scripts start_tornadoes.py 

We recommend running 2 tornado instances per core on your machine

Install nginx as follows:
http://wiki.nginx.org/Install

To test that nginx is installed:
$ sudo nginx -t  

  the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
  configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful        
  
We recommend modifying your nginx config to be similar to sample_nginx_conf

restart nginx:
$ sudo nginx -s stop
$ sudo nginx

Now modify the tornado_bidder within the !!!!!!!! to add your custom logic.
restart your tornado servers:
$ python start_tornadoes.py      
$ python stop_tornadoes.py
